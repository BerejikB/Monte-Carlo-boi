#Answers to question in assignment

##Why do we multiply the value from step 5 above by 4?
	
	To be completly honest, I have no idea. And I have no idea what the value even is. 
	

##What do you observe in the output when running your program with parameters of increasing size?
	The total number of hypotenuses over 1 increases, as would be expected, if the pool of possible values is larger, then the number of values that could be over 1 should also increase.
	

##If you run the program multiple times with the same parameter, does the output remain the same? Why or why not?
	The "estimation of pi" remains the same. 
	The total number of hypotenuses > 0 increases hoewver, as it should.
	

##Find a parameter that requires multiple seconds of run time. What is that parameter? How accurate is the estimated value of Ï€?
	No parameter I can input will cause over 1 second of run time without causing System.OverflowException


##Research one other use of Monte-Carlo methods. Record it in your exercise submission and be prepared to discuss it in class.
